#### Peppa Pig App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts.


### MVP
1. App should display a TV set in the centre of the page with icons around to enter different activities.
2. Daddy Pig activity: TV will display google map of where Daddy Pig has gone with information about the location.
3. Mummy Pig activity: TV will display various animal characters from Peppa Pig with images of their real counterparts.

## Extensions
1. Peppa Pig activity: TV will become a canvas for drawing.
2. Madame Gazelle activity: TV will play songs or videos.
3. Daddy Pig activity will have functionality to read the information out loud.
4. Mummy Pig activity will play animal noises for each animal.
